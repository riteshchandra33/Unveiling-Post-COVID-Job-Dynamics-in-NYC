# Unveiling-Post-COVID-Job-Dynamics-in-NYC

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the evolving job landscape in New York City during the post-COVID era, specifically from 2021 to 2023. The goal is to uncover trends in job postings, skill demands, salary bands, and geographic shifts in opportunities using data-driven approaches across Python, R, and SQL.

Conducted as part of a final project for AIT 580 at George Mason University, the analysis aims to inform job seekers, policy-makers, and businesses with strategic insights derived from large-scale NYC job data.

## 🛠 Tools & Methodologies

| Language | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| **Python** (`Data_Manipulation.ipynb`) | Data preprocessing, filtering, correlation analysis |
| **R** (`Data_Visualization.R`) | Data visualization, regression models, skill analysis |
| **SQL** (`Data_Mapping.sql`) | Structured queries for job sector exploration and aggregation |

✔️ Used advanced EDA and visual storytelling  
✔️ Cleaned data using both Excel & Python  
✔️ Applied regression and statistical correlation (Pearson's `r`, `p-value`)
